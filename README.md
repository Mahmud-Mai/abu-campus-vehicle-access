### Campus Vehicle Check-In System

This project presents the development of a web-based "Campus Vehicle Check-In System." The system leverages React, Node.js, tesseractJS and MongoDB to create a versatile application accessible via smartphones and personal computers. Smartphone cameras and PC webcams are utilized, ensuring both portability for security personnel and administrative convenience for system management.

The core functionality of the system involves Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for scanning vehicle license plate numbers. Real-time decisions on granting or denying access are made based on the scanned data.
The application serves two primary user groups: security personnel, who use it to scan vehicle plate numbers and manage access, and administrators, who utilize the PC version for system administration tasks such as adding new vehicles, creating user accounts, and generating reports.

This project addresses challenges related to OCR accuracy, particularly in recognizing license plate numbers. Solutions explored include considering premium OCR providers like AWS and Google Cloud Vision to enhance accuracy.
The Campus Vehicle Check-In System holds the potential to significantly enhance security and operational efficiency regarding vehicle access control on university premises. Additionally, it offers the capability to collect valuable data on vehicle movements in and out of the campus.
