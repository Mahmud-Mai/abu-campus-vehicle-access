## INTRO

This project outlines the development of a mobile-based vehicle access control system for university premises. The system will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology through smartphone cameras to scan vehicle plate numbers and make real-time decisions on granting or denying access. The project will be implemented using MERN Stack.
